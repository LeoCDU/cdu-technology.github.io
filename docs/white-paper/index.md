# CDU White Paper

CDU brand, Hong Kong international meme currency - concept of issuing currency to repay debt,

Mission: An experiment to solve the economic lending crisis in the AI ​​era;

Vision: Help 1 million people solve their debt repayment problems; Values: Innovation, fairness and trust, open cooperation.

## 1. Overall concept (CDU, Clear-Delt-USD, Hong Kong Chinese name is "Debt Repayment Coin")

1. CDU is Hong Kong’s meme2.0 experimental coin, with a total of 105 trillion coins (5 trillion airdrops), minted fairly and at low cost for everyone.
2. The goal of the CDU is an experimental project to solve the economy's lending crisis.Global personal debt totals approximately $100 trillion, which is very serious. The CDU project team believes that the traditional financial system has caused a lending crisis due to uneven distribution, borrowing and consumption, and is unsustainable, and cannot solve the economic lending crisis on its own. Satoshi Nakamoto's
3. Although Bitcoin solves the "cause" of centralized finance, it does not directly solve the "effect" of the lending crisis.
4. CDU hopes to partially and directly solve the problem of the economic lending crisis by allowing ordinary people to repay their debts by minting CDU and waiting for appreciation.
5. The appreciation theory of CDU is based on the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Work can be handed over to robots or artificial intelligence, and ordinary people can obtain dividends by casting and issuing their own cryptocurrency. This theory has been proven by many successful examples in the crypto market.

## 2. Economic model

Low-cost and fair issuance of minted CDU, only 5 trillion CDU is reserved in advance for market airdrop, and the team does not make other reservations.

The price formula for minting CDU is simple and clear. The price is becoming more and more valuable. It is connected to DEX and can be traded on DEX immediately.

Pay attention to ecological construction, including a list of consultants and contributors, market making reserves, etc.

- A. Payment cost USDT allocation:
  - 5% share distribution
  - 50% DEX capital pool + 20% market making reserve fund
  - 5% first-level cooperation platform
  - 20% project team
- B. Only 5 trillion CDU are reserved in advance for market airdrops.

- C. 100% of the amount of CDU minted by the user is given to the user, and at the same time, there is an additional quota of CDU (the proportion of the number of CDU minted by the user):
  - 5% share distribution
  - 50% DEX capital pool + 20% market making reserve fund
  - 5% list of consultants and contributors
  - 20% project team

## 3. Team

CDU team BASE is based in Hong Kong and has extensive experience in the cryptocurrency industry. Hong Kong is promoting the development of the web3 industry by strengthening supervision, and Hong Kong needs excellent web3 projects.

## 4. Marketing Cooperation

CDU will adopt a variety of marketing cooperation models, including unified brand operations, low-cost fair coinage, market airdrops, etc.

## 5. The story of CDU

The founder of the CDU team once fell into bankruptcy due to lending and relied on the return of the cryptocurrency king. This time, he hopes CDU can help more people deal with their debt problems.
There are many wealth stories in the history of the crypto market, and we are all looking forward to the next wealth story, and even eager to be the protagonist of the wealth story.

## 6. Three major rules and conclusions

Project value, CDU price, and user trust are the three main rules for the survival of encryption projects:

1. Except for the 5 trillion CDU market airdrop, the team does not reserve other CDU. The team’s income relies on user trust and users pay to mint CDU.
2. In order to maintain the market price of CDU, up to 50% USDT and a maximum of 25 trillion CDU are invested in the DEX (decentralized exchange) black hole during casting as a guarantee. No one can interfere. There are still 20% USDT and 20% during casting. A proportion of the quota CDU is directly invested in the liquidity pool, and a team manages its liquidity.
3. Invest such a high proportion of income assets and issuance assets into DEX, and write them into self-executing smart contracts (commonly known as black holes). No one can change the smart contracts, which means that most of the assets are established on DEX in an unmanned and automatic way. A price transaction guarantee pool has been established to protect the price of CDU assets obtained by users.
4. Adequate and necessary liquidity management is also aimed at maintaining market prices and expectations.
5. Very few projects on the market can achieve this, and the CDU project is in line with such a handful of projects.

CDU is a novel meme coin with the potential to solve the economy’s lending crisis. CDU’s team has rich experience, diverse marketing cooperation models, and its stories are also contagious. The future development of CDU is worth looking forward to.

## 7. Comments

CDU is an innovative project that attempts to solve the economic lending crisis by issuing CDU. The appreciation theory of CDU is based on the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Work can be handed over to robots or artificial intelligence, and ordinary people can obtain dividends by casting and issuing their own cryptocurrency with their own hands. This theory has certain feasibility, but there are also some risks, such as the price fluctuation risk of CDU and the credit risk of the project team.
Overall, CDU is a project with potential, but investors also need to carefully assess the risks before investing.

## PS:

## 1. Cryptocurrency Appreciation Theory

The success of various currencies is due to the marketization and liberalization of minting rights. Traditional currency issuance rights are in the hands of the central bank, which results in currency issuance not subject to market supply and demand and can easily lead to inflation. The emergence of cryptocurrency has broken the central bank's currency issuance monopoly and returned the right to mint money to the market, which makes cryptocurrency have a certain value.
The value endorsement and reason for survival of cryptocurrencies are based on free economic and financial spillover dividends. The emergence of industrial robots and artificial intelligence will lead to a significant drop in production costs, thereby generating a large amount of free economic and financial spillover dividends. Cryptocurrency can convert these spillover dividends into currency through minting, which gives cryptocurrency a certain value basis.

The success of each cryptocurrency will eliminate some borrowing and promote the expansion of economic consumption. The minting cost of cryptocurrency is relatively low, which allows ordinary people to participate in cryptocurrency investment. As cryptocurrency becomes more popular, people will have more money to spend, which will boost economic growth. The success of cryptocurrency has actually deeply tapped the production and consumption potential in the era of industrial robots and AI.

The emergence of cryptocurrency provides people with a new way of investment, which will attract more people to participate in economic activities, thereby promoting economic growth. In addition, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency will also help promote financial innovation, thereby providing new impetus for economic development.

Cryptocurrencies have positive sides, but they also come with certain risks. Cryptocurrency carries certain investment risks, and investors need to pay attention to risk control. In addition, cryptocurrency also has certain regulatory risks, and supervision needs to be strengthened to protect the rights and interests of investors.

## 2. CDU is a project of BASE in Hong Kong. The issuance and trading are not open to the following countries and regions: Mainland China, Saudi Arabia, etc.

## 3. Minting CDU price formula (the curve rises, the earlier the cheaper, the later the more expensive; the price of 1 billion CDUs ranges from 1USDT to 1000USDT)

The price of the Xth CDU is P = (0.1 + X / 1 trillions) \* 0.00000001 (USDT)

- X refers to the quantity segment [X, Y] that the user mints starting with the
- A is a constant, A=0.00000001 (7 zeros after the decimal point).
- In line with the price of the first CDU at the beginning P= 0.1_A (USDT), the price of the last CDU (the 100 trillionth CDU) P= 100.1_A (USDT), P has appreciated 1000 times.
- When the market first opened, the price curve rose relatively steeply, attracting early users to participate and giving back to early users.
- Each user can mint a minimum of 100 million CDU and a maximum of 100 billion CDU.

Example:

- For example, if a user mints CDUs in the quantity range 【X = 500 billion, Y = 500.1 billion】, X is the 500 billionth one, and the price of X is P = (0.1 + 500 billion / 1 trillions) _ 0.00000001 (USDT) = (0.1 + 0.5) _ 0.00000001 (USDT) = 0.000000006 (USDT). The quantity of CDUs that the user mints is Y - X = 500.1billion - 500 billion = 100 million, and the cost of minting is the price P = 0.000000006 (USDT) \* quantity 100 million = 0.6 (USDT).
- For example, if a user mints CDUs in the quantity range 【X = 10 trillions, Y = 10.001 trillions】, X is the 10 trillions CDU, and the price P = (0.1+10 trillions / 1 trillions) _ A (USDT) = 10.1_ 0.00000001 (USDT) = 0.0000001 1(USDT). The quantity of CDUs that the user mints is Y - X = 10.001 trillions - 10 trillions = 1 billion, and the cost of minting is the price P = 0.00000011 (USDT) \* quantity 1 billion = 110 (USDT).
- For example, if X is the 100 trillionth CDU, the price P = (0.1+100 trillions/1 trillions) _ A (USDT) = 100.1 _ 0.00000001 = 0.000001001 (USDT).
