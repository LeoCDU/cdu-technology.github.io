## CDU Story

- The founder of the CDU team once fell into bankruptcy due to lending and relied on the return of the cryptocurrency king. This time, he hopes CDU can help more people deal with their debt problems.
- There are many wealth stories in the history of the crypto market, and we are all looking forward to the next wealth story, and even eager to be the protagonist of the wealth story.

## Three major rules and conclusions

Project value, CDU price, and user trust are the three main rules for the survival of encryption projects:

1. Except for the 5 trillion CDU market airdrop, the team does not reserve other CDU. The team’s income relies on user trust and users pay to mint CDU.
2. In order to maintain the market price of CDU, up to 50% USDT and a maximum of 25 trillion CDU are invested in the DEX (decentralized exchange) black hole during casting as a guarantee. No one can interfere. There are still 20% USDT and 20% during casting. A proportion of the quota CDU is directly invested in the liquidity pool, and a team manages its liquidity.
3. Invest such a high proportion of income assets and issuance assets into DEX, and write them into self-executing smart contracts (commonly known as black holes). No one can change the smart contracts, which means that most of the assets are established on DEX in an unmanned and automatic way. A price transaction guarantee pool has been established to protect the price of CDU assets obtained by users.
4. Adequate and necessary liquidity management is also aimed at maintaining market prices and expectations.
5. Very few projects on the market can achieve this, and the CDU project is in line with such a handful of projects.

CDU is a novel meme coin with the potential to solve the economy’s lending crisis. CDU’s team has rich experience, diverse marketing cooperation models, and its stories are also contagious. The future development of CDU is worth looking forward to.

## Comment

CDU is an innovative project that attempts to solve the economic lending crisis by issuing CDU. The appreciation theory of CDU is based on the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Work can be handed over to robots or artificial intelligence, and ordinary people can obtain dividends by casting and issuing their own cryptocurrency with their own hands. This theory has certain feasibility, but there are also some risks, such as the price fluctuation risk of CDU and the credit risk of the project team.
Overall, CDU is a project with potential, but investors also need to carefully assess the risks before investing.
