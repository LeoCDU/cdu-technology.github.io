## Vision and mission

CDU brand, Hong Kong international meme currency - concept of issuing currency to repay debt,

Mission: An experiment to solve the economic lending crisis in the AI ​​era;

Vision: Help 1 million people solve their debt repayment problems;

Values: Innovation, fairness, trust, open cooperation.

## General concept

1. CDU is Hong Kong’s meme2.0 experimental coin, with a total of 105 trillion coins (5 trillion airdrops), minted fairly and at low cost for everyone.
2. The goal of the CDU is an experimental project to solve the economy's lending crisis.
3. Global personal debt totals approximately $100 trillion, which is very serious. The CDU project team believes that the traditional financial system has caused a lending crisis due to uneven distribution, borrowing and consumption, and is unsustainable, and cannot solve the economic lending crisis on its own. Although Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin solved the “cause” of centralized finance, it did not directly solve the “effect” of the lending crisis.
4. CDU hopes to partially and directly solve the problem of the economic lending crisis by allowing ordinary people to repay their debts by minting CDU and waiting for appreciation.
5. The appreciation theory of CDU is based on the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Work can be handed over to robots or artificial intelligence, and ordinary people can obtain dividends by casting and issuing their own cryptocurrency. This theory has been proven by many successful examples in the crypto market.
