# CDU mechanism

## Protocol features:

1. Fair and just token issuance, everyone has equal coinage rights;
2. At the same time, Mint automatically adds a liquidity pool, which solves the problem of small chips in the initial stage of the liquidity pool and difficulty in entering large funds;
3. The LP contract enters the black hole and is destroyed, and no one can withdraw from the liquidity pool, eliminating the risk of Rug;
4. Allow deployers to set position conditions to prevent witch accounts from rapidly minting coins on a large scale;

## Operating mechanism

1. Fair launch: The protocol guarantees that there will be no unfair behavior during the token issuance process.
2. Automatically add LP: When using the protocol Mint token, half of the tokens and Mint fees will be automatically added to the liquidity pool, achieving a more scientific chip allocation and solving the problem of no one adding liquidity in the early stages of the project and later liquidity problems. The liquidity pool has very few chips and it is difficult to attract large amounts of funds. And it can reduce transaction costs and risks, and increase market attractiveness and competitiveness.
3. Black hole contract: In order to ensure the safety of funds and prevent deployers from doing evil, the protocol introduces the concept of black hole contract. All LP contracts added to the liquidity pool will be sent to the black hole for destruction, meaning no one has ownership of the LP contract and no one can manipulate or withdraw funds from the pool. It can promote the healthy development and long-term stability of the market and reduce market risks and uncertainties. It will also help attract more investors to enter the market, increase market liquidity and activity, and lay a solid foundation for the prosperity and development of the market.
